Updated user_responses Table
Schema
sql
Copy
CREATE TABLE public.user_responses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(), -- Primary key for the table
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE, -- Foreign key
    name TEXT NOT NULL, -- Name for the response (optional)
    responses JSONB NOT NULL, -- Stores user responses as JSONB
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL, -- Timestamp for creation
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL -- Timestamp for updates
);
Key Columns:
id: Primary key for the user_responses table. Each response has a unique id.

user_id: Foreign key referencing auth.users(id). This links each response to a specific user in the auth.users table.

responses: JSONB column to store user responses (e.g., {"question1": "answer1", "question2": "answer2"}).

created_at: Automatically records when the response was created.

updated_at: Automatically updates whenever the response is modified.

Foreign Key Relationship
user_id references auth.users(id).

ON DELETE CASCADE: If a user is deleted from auth.users, all their associated responses in user_responses are automatically deleted.

ON UPDATE CASCADE: If the id of a user in auth.users is updated, the user_id in user_responses is automatically updated.

Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
Policy for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
sql
Copy
CREATE POLICY "User can manage their own responses"
ON public.user_responses
FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id) -- Restrict access to rows where auth.uid() matches user_id
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id); -- Ensure users can only insert/update their own data
Key Points:
USING: Ensures users can only access rows where auth.uid() = user_id.

WITH CHECK: Ensures users can only insert or update rows where auth.uid() = user_id.

RLS must be enabled on the user_responses table:

sql
Copy
ALTER TABLE public.user_responses ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
Automating updated_at Field
To automatically update the updated_at field whenever a row is modified, create a trigger:

sql
Copy
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = now();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

CREATE TRIGGER update_user_responses_updated_at
BEFORE UPDATE ON public.user_responses
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();
Key Points to Remember When Refactoring Code
Always Use user_id for User-Specific Operations:

When querying, updating, or deleting responses, always filter by user_id (not id).

Example: WHERE user_id = 'user-uuid'.

Use auth.uid() for RLS:

Supabase automatically provides auth.uid() for authenticated users. Use this to enforce RLS in your queries.

Foreign Key Relationship:

The user_id column links to auth.users(id). Ensure that any user-specific operations reference this column.

JSONB for responses:

The responses column stores user responses as JSONB. Use Supabase's JSONB functions (e.g., ->, ->>, #>, #>>) to query or update nested data.

Timestamps:

Use created_at and updated_at for tracking when responses were created or modified.
